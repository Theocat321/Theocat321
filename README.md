# Welcome  :wave:
Who am I? <br>
My name is Adam, I an A level student. I study Maths, Physics and Computer Science - ofc. Along with this I play footballer in English non-league as a goal keeper. I am eager to learn more about the computer science field as I narrow down which area of the vast field I want to pursue my career! I believe experience is key, therefore I will use this github account to showcase some of my projects and work...
