# Welcome  :wave:
Who am I? <br>
My name is Adam and I am a 17 year old in sixth form. I study Maths, Physics and Computer Science - ofc. Along with this I play footballer in English non-league as a goal keeper. I am eager to learn more about the computer science field as I slowly narrow down which area of the vast field I want to pursue my career! I believe experience is key, therefore I will use this github account to showcase some of my projects and work...

# Current Projects :clipboard:

### Pirate Game üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è

This passion project is built by a team of students at my school. It is a game hosted on a vps with a custom URL. Click [Here](https://pirategame.live/) to view the project in its current, live state. The proejct was a personal development project to gain insight to how web development works and standard industry themes. We have created an online game where a player creates a game and receives a gameID. This gameID is given to other players in order to join the game. Nicknames are entered then the game begins. You must first fill out a grid full of items that are used in the game. Once everyone is ready, the host presses start game. The playing_online page is shown to the user along with their grid, their retaliation items and a game log. The host presses next turn and a grid square is picked at random, everyone will then apply their item in that grid square - whether its money, a steal, a bank, ect. This contiunes until there are no grid squares left. Now the leaderboard screen is displayed with thte scores.

### Learning Data

Recently I have really developed an understanding of the importance of data. How our whole world runs of these 1s and 0s that when combined can create personal portfolios about yourselves. So as i prep to taking my steps into higher education and the world as a general, I would like to focus my area of attention to data. My repo linked below is a demonstration of my work so far. I have developed my knowledge of web scrapping in order to obtain data, and building classification models on that data for binary results. The second repo linked is my main project for this direction of study as of now. It is not complete!<br>

My friends and I created our organisation named A-Level-Coding collab where we develope our pirate game project together. Currently, this is where the some of my time is spent coding outside of lesson. Click [here](https://github.com/A-Level-Personal-Code-Collab) to view the organisation main page!

## Previous projects

### HLStock update üìà

Every week i look at the top 10 companies in a specified amount of funds and manually compare the data from last weeks data that i have recorded. This became tedious so i created a web scraping program that will create CSV files for the current data, the last week data ( scrapped last week ) and the differences betweem them. Everything can be seen in [this](https://github.com/Theocat321/HLStockUpdate) repo
