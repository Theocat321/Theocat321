# Welcome  :wave:
Who am I? <br>
My name is Adam and I am a 16 year old in sixth form. I study Maths, Physics and Computer Science - ofc. Along with this I am semi-professional footballer in English non-league. I am eager to learn more about the computer science field as I slowly narrow down which area of the vast field I want to pursue my career! I believe experience is key, therefore I will use this github account to showcase some of my projects and work...

I would love to hear about learning ideas so please feel free to contact me!

# Current Projects :clipboard:

### Pirate Game 🏴‍☠️

This passion project is built by a team of students at my school. It is a game hosted on a vps with a custom URL. Click [Here](https://pirategame.live/) to view the project in its current, live state. The proejct was a personal development project to gain insight to how web development works and standard industry themes. We have created an online game where a player creates a game and receives a gameID. This gameID is given to other players in order to join the game. Nicknames are entered then the game begins. You must first fill out a grid full of items that are used in the game. Once everyone is ready, the host presses start game. The playing_online page is shown to the user along with their grid, their retaliation items and a game log. The host presses next turn and a grid square is picked at random, everyone will then apply their item in that grid square - whether its money, a steal, a bank, ect. This contiunes until there are no grid squares left. Now the leaderboard screen is displayed with thte scores.

### HLStock update 📈

Every week i look at the top 10 companies in a specified amount of funds and manually compare the data from last weeks data that i have recorded. This became tedious so i created a web scraping program that will create CSV files for the current data, the last week data ( scrapped last week ) and the differences betweem them. Everything can be seen in [this](https://github.com/Theocat321/HLStockUpdate) repo
