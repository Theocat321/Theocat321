# Hey, I'm Adam 👋  

I’m a builder who loves turning ambitious ideas into working products.  
I’ve spent the last few years moving fast between **hackathons, startups, and big tech**  

Along the way, I’ve built and shipped across **AI, data, and developer tools** - from prototypes hacked together in hours to platforms deployed in production.

## 🚀 Projects & Builds  

- **PromptStream**: a UI-first LLMOps platform for prompt experimentation, with SDKs for React & Python.  
- **Stealth Project**: Agentic chat canvas for research & knowledge management.  
- **Alethium**: B2B supply-chain & trade-finance automation.  
- **Clueless**: an AI workflow helper that won **$32K in prizes** at the AI Engine Hackathon.  
- **Tiger MOM**: real-time Mom Test assistant that listens to your calls and nudges you back on track.  

I’ve also been lucky to win **multiple hackathons** (ElevenLabs Omi Hackathon, AI Engine Hack, HackSouthWest, and more) with some of these projects.
